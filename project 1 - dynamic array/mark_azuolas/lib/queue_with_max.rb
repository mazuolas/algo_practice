# Implement a queue with #enqueue and #dequeue, as well as a #max API,
# a method which returns the maximum element still in the queue. This
# is trivial to do by spending O(n) time upon dequeuing.
# Can you do it in O(1) amortized? Maybe use an auxiliary storage structure?

# Use your RingBuffer to achieve optimal shifts! Write any additional
# methods you need.
